# CS-Project
As of 22/2/22 this project is now finished.

PC Customs is a python script that is used to select components for making a PC.

This Software helps the user by suggesting various different options available in the market for the components that are best suitable for the given PC.

The user needs to enter their PC make type, model and parent company for the program to analyse the best possible make types. The user can then choose their choice of make by selecting the RAM capacity, Processor, Graphic Card, etc.

The software even connects the user with various other vendors online where their chosen components are available.
